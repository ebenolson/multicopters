Untitled Quadcopter Build
=========================

This untitled quadcopter is designed to reuse the same components from the [betamax quad](http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/doku.php?id=hacks:betamax10quad). The main goal for this design is to be as sturdy as possible for a stable flying platform.

Features
--------

* Light. Entire frame weighs in at 250g. With all electronics, motors and batteries it comes in at 718g.
* Room for qbrain ESC and battery from betamax kit within the frame.
* Battery has more protection in the centre of the frame.
* Can be configured to fly in either the X or + layout.

Possible Improvements
---------------------

* Perhaps an all 1/4" variant, stronger top and bottom plates might make for a stronger frame, might be overkill.
* Flight controller cage? 
* It needs a name.

Bill of Materials

Assembly

Laser Cutting
-------------

All parts are cut from 1/4" ply with the exception of the top and bottom plates which are cut from 1/8". The stability of the frame comes from how well the top and bottom plates fit, the tighter the better. The current design is based of plywood that is around 5.7mm thick and a laser kerf of 0.2mm, if your plywood is different then the top and bottom plates should be scaled to fit.

The direction of the grain is also important, the frame arm should be parallel with the grain while 1/8" plates should be on a 45 degree angle from frame slots.
